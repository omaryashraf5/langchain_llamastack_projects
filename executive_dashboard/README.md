# Executive Dashboard for Retail Chain Analytics

A comprehensive executive dashboard built with Streamlit, Pandas, and LangChain for C-suite executives to track sales, operational efficiency, and customer trends.

## Features

### ðŸ“Š Key Metrics
- **Revenue Tracking**: Total revenue, average transaction values, transaction counts
- **Profit Analysis**: Profit margins, gross profit calculations by region
- **Inventory Management**: Stock levels, inventory turnover, low stock alerts
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Average satisfaction scores, customer lifetime value

### ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations
- **Time-Series Charts**: Revenue trends over time
- **Bar Charts**: Store performance comparisons, regional profit margins
- **Heatmaps**: Regional performance metrics (Revenue, Cost, Profit)
- **Pie Charts**: Inventory distribution by stock levels
- **KPI Indicators**: Real-time metric displays

### ðŸ’¬ Natural Language Queries
Ask questions in plain English:
- "Which stores are underperforming in Q3 2025?"
- "What's driving high costs in Region X?"
- "Show top stores by profit"
- "Which items have low stock levels?"

### ðŸš¨ Anomaly Detection
Automatic detection and alerts for:
- Stores with revenue significantly above/below average
- Critically low inventory levels
- Unusual expense spikes

## Data Sources

The dashboard uses five Excel datasets:
- `Customer-Purchase-History.xlsx` - Customer transactions and satisfaction scores
- `Inventory-Tracking.xlsx` - Stock levels and inventory data
- `Online-Store-Orders.xlsx` - Online sales transactions
- `Product-Sales-Region.xlsx` - Regional sales and cost data
- `Retail-Store-Transactions.xlsx` - Physical store transaction data

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Ensure your data files are in the correct location:
```
executive_dashboard/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sales_data/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Customer-Purchase-History.xlsx

## Components

### DataLoader (`data_loader.py`)
- Loads all Excel datasets
- Provides data summaries
- Manages data access for other components

### MetricsCalculator (`metrics_calculator.py`)
- Calculates revenue, profit, inventory, and customer metrics
- Aggregates store and regional performance
- Detects anomalies using statistical methods (z-scores)

### DashboardVisualizations (`visualizations.py`)
- Creates interactive Plotly charts
- Generates time-series, bar, heatmap, and pie charts
- Builds KPI indicator displays

### QueryAgent (`query_agent.py`)
- Processes natural language queries
- Provides fallback query handling
- Analyzes underperforming stores, regional costs, and profit leaders

## Example Queries

Try asking these questions in the "Ask Questions" tab:

1. **Performance Analysis**
   - "Which stores are underperforming?"
   - "Show me the top 5 stores by revenue"
   - "What stores have the highest profit margins?"

2. **Regional Insights**
   - "What's driving high costs in the Northeast region?"
   - "Compare revenue across all regions"
   - "Which region has the best profit margin?"

3. **Inventory Management**
   - "Which products have low stock levels?"
   - "Show inventory distribution"
   - "What items need restocking?"

## Customization

### Adding New Metrics
Edit `metrics_calculator.py` to add new calculation methods:
```python
def calculate_new_metric(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
    # Your calculation logic
    return metrics
```

### Creating New Visualizations
Add new chart methods in `visualizations.py`:
```python
def create_new_chart(self):
    # Your chart logic using Plotly
    return fig
```

### Extending Query Capabilities
Add new query handlers in `query_agent.py`:
```python
def _handle_custom_query(self, question: str) -> str:
    # Your query logic
    return result
```

## Dependencies

- `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis
- `streamlit` - Web dashboard framework
- `plotly` - Interactive visualizations
- `openpyxl` - Excel file reading
- `langchain` - LLM integration for queries
- `numpy` - Numerical computations

## Performance Optimization

The dashboard uses Streamlit's caching mechanisms:
- `@st.cache_resource` for data loading (loads once per session)
- Efficient data aggregation with pandas
- Lazy loading of visualizations

## Troubleshooting

### Data Loading Issues
- Verify Excel files are in `data/sales_data/` directory
- Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure openpyxl is installed: `pip install openpyxl`

### Visualization Errors
- Check that data columns exist in the datasets
- Verify Plotly is installed: `pip install plotly`
- Review browser console for JavaScript errors

### Query Agent Issues
- The agent uses fallback methods if LLM is not configured
- Check LangChain installation: `pip install langchain`
- Queries work without LLM using pattern matching

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Real-time data updates
- LLM integration for advanced queries
- Export functionality (PDF reports, Excel exports)
- Drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis
- Time-based filtering (quarters, months, custom ranges)
- Predictive analytics and forecasting
- Multi-user authentication and role-based access
